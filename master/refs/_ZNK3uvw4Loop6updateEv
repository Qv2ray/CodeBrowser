     * @brief Updates the event loop’s concept of _now_.
     *
     * The current time is cached at the start of the event loop tick in order
     * to reduce the number of time-related system calls.&lt;br/&gt;
     * You won’t normally need to call this function unless you have callbacks
     * that block the event loop for longer periods of time, where _longer_ is
     * somewhat subjective but probably on the order of a millisecond or more.
