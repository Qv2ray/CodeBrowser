     * @brief Checks if the handle is active.
     *
     * What _active_ means depends on the type of handle:
     *
     * * An AsyncHandle handle is always active and cannot be deactivated,
     * except by closing it with uv_close().
     * * A PipeHandle, TCPHandle, UDPHandle, etc. handle - basically any handle
     * that deals with I/O - is active when it is doing something that involves
     * I/O, like reading, writing, connecting, accepting new connections, etc.
     * * A CheckHandle, IdleHandle, TimerHandle, etc. handle is active when it
     * has been started with a call to `start()`.
     *
     * Rule of thumb: if a handle of type `FooHandle` has a `start()` member
     * method, then itâ€™s active from the moment that method is called. Likewise,
     * `stop()` deactivates the handle again.
     *
     * @return True if the handle is active, false otherwise.
