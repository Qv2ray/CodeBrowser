<doc f='include/grpc/grpc.h' l='325'>/** Called by clients to cancel an RPC on the server.
    Can be called multiple times, from any thread.
    If a status has not been received for the call, set it to the status code
    and description passed in.
    Importantly, this function does not send status nor description to the
    remote endpoint.
    Note that \a description doesn&apos;t need be a static string.
    It doesn&apos;t need to be alive after the call to
    grpc_call_cancel_with_status completes.
