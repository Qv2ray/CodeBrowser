<doc f='include/google/protobuf/io/zero_copy_stream.h' l='147'>// Backs up a number of bytes, so that the next call to Next() returns
  // data again that was already returned by the last call to Next().  This
  // is useful when writing procedures that are only supposed to read up
  // to a certain point in the input, then return.  If Next() returns a
  // buffer that goes beyond what you wanted to read, you can use BackUp()
  // to return to the point where you intended to finish.
  //
  // Preconditions:
  // * The last method called must have been Next().
  // * count must be less than or equal to the size of the last buffer
  //   returned by Next().
  //
  // Postconditions:
  // * The last &quot;count&quot; bytes of the last buffer returned by Next() will be
  //   pushed back into the stream.  Subsequent calls to Next() will return
  //   the same data again before producing new data.</doc>
