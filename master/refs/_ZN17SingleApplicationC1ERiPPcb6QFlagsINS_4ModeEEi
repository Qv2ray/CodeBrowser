     * @brief Intitializes a SingleApplication instance with argc command line
     * arguments in argv
     * @arg {int &amp;} argc - Number of arguments in argv
     * @arg {const char *[]} argv - Supplied command line arguments
     * @arg {bool} allowSecondary - Whether to start the instance as secondary
     * if there is already a primary instance.
     * @arg {Mode} mode - Whether for the SingleApplication block to be applied
     * User wide or System wide.
     * @arg {int} timeout - Timeout to wait in milliseconds.
     * @note argc and argv may be changed as Qt removes arguments that it
     * recognizes
     * @note Mode::SecondaryNotification only works if set on both the primary
     * instance and the secondary instance.
     * @note The timeout is just a hint for the maximum time of blocking
     * operations. It does not guarantee that the SingleApplication
     * initialisation will be completed in given time, though is a good hint.
     * Usually 4*timeout would be the worst case (fail) scenario.
     * @see See the corresponding QAPPLICATION_CLASS constructor for reference
