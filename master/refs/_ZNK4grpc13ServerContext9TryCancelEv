<doc f='include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/server_context.h' l='143'>/// Cancel the Call from the server. This is a best-effort API and
  /// depending on when it is called, the RPC may still appear successful to
  /// the client.
  /// For example, if TryCancel() is called on a separate thread, it might race
  /// with the server handler which might return success to the client before
  /// TryCancel() was even started by the thread.
  ///
  /// It is the caller&apos;s responsibility to prevent such races and ensure that if
  /// TryCancel() is called, the serverhandler must return Status::CANCELLED.
  /// The only exception is that if the serverhandler is already returning an
  /// error status code, it is ok to not return Status::CANCELLED even if
  /// TryCancel() was called.
  ///
  /// Note that TryCancel() does not change any of the tags that are pending
  /// on the completion queue. All pending tags will still be delivered
  /// (though their ok result may reflect the effect of cancellation).</doc>
