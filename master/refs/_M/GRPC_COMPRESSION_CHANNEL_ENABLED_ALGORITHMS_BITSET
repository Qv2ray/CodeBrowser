 * Its value is a bitset (an int). Bits correspond to algorithms in \a
 * grpc_compression_algorithm. For example, its LSB corresponds to
 * GRPC_COMPRESS_NONE, the next bit to GRPC_COMPRESS_DEFLATE, etc.
 * Unset bits disable support for the algorithm. By default all algorithms are
 * supported. It&apos;s not possible to disable GRPC_COMPRESS_NONE (the attempt will
 * be ignored). */</doc>
