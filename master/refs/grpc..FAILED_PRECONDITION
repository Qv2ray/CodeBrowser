<doc f='include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/status_code_enum.h' l='72'>/// Operation was rejected because the system is not in a state required for
  /// the operation&apos;s execution. For example, directory to be deleted may be
  /// non-empty, an rmdir operation is applied to a non-directory, etc.
  ///
  /// A litmus test that may help a service implementor in deciding
  /// between FAILED_PRECONDITION, ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE:
  ///  (a) Use UNAVAILABLE if the client can retry just the failing call.
  ///  (b) Use ABORTED if the client should retry at a higher-level
  ///      (e.g., restarting a read-modify-write sequence).
  ///  (c) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client should not retry until
  ///      the system state has been explicitly fixed. E.g., if an &quot;rmdir&quot;
  ///      fails because the directory is non-empty, FAILED_PRECONDITION
  ///      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
  ///      they have first fixed up the directory by deleting files from it.
  ///  (d) Use FAILED_PRECONDITION if the client performs conditional
  ///      REST Get/Update/Delete on a resource and the resource on the
  ///      server does not match the condition. E.g., conflicting
  ///      read-modify-write on the same resource.</doc>
