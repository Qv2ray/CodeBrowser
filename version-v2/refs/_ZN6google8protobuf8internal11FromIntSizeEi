<doc f='include/google/protobuf/message_lite.h' l='75'>// We mainly calculate sizes in terms of size_t, but some functions that
// compute sizes return &quot;int&quot;.  These int sizes are expected to always be
// positive. This function is more efficient than casting an int to size_t
// directly on 64-bit platforms because it avoids making the compiler emit a
// sign extending instruction, which we don&apos;t want and don&apos;t want to pay for.</doc>
