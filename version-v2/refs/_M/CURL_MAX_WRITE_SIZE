     Windows, while 16K for some odd reason performed a lot better.
     We do the ifndef check to allow this value to easier be changed at build
     time for those who feel adventurous. The practical minimum is about
     400 bytes since libcurl uses a buffer of this size as a scratch area
     (unrelated to network send operations). */</doc>
