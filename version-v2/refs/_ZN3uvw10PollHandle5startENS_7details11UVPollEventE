     * @brief Starts polling the file descriptor.
     *
     * Available flags are:
     *
     * * `PollHandle::Event::READABLE`
     * * `PollHandle::Event::WRITABLE`
     * * `PollHandle::Event::DISCONNECT`
     * * `PollHandle::Event::PRIORITIZED`
     *
     * As soon as an event is detected, a PollEvent is emitted by the
     * handle.&lt;br&gt;
     * It could happen that ErrorEvent events are emitted while running.
     *
     * Calling more than once this method will update the flags to which the
     * caller is interested.
     *
     * @param event The event to which the caller is interested.
