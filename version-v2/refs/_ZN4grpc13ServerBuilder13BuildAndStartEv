  // Primary API&apos;s

  /// Return a running server which is ready for processing calls.
  /// Before calling, one typically needs to ensure that:
  ///  1. a service is registered - so that the server knows what to serve
  ///     (via RegisterService, or RegisterAsyncGenericService)
  ///  2. a listening port has been added - so the server knows where to receive
  ///     traffic (via AddListeningPort)
  ///  3. [for async api only] completion queues have been added via
  ///     AddCompletionQueue</doc>
