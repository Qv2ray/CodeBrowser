<doc f='include/google/protobuf/stubs/common.h' l='181'>// ===================================================================
// Shutdown support.

// Shut down the entire protocol buffers library, deleting all static-duration
// objects allocated by the library or by generated .pb.cc files.
//
// There are two reasons you might want to call this:
// * You use a draconian definition of &quot;memory leak&quot; in which you expect
//   every single malloc() to have a corresponding free(), even for objects
//   which live until program exit.
// * You are writing a dynamically-loaded library which needs to clean up
//   after itself when the library is unloaded.
//
// It is safe to call this multiple times.  However, it is not safe to use
// any other part of the protocol buffers library after
// ShutdownProtobufLibrary() has been called. Furthermore this call is not
// thread safe, user needs to synchronize multiple calls.</doc>
