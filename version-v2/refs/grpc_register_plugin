<doc f='include/grpc/grpc.h' l='51'>/** Registers a plugin to be initialized and destroyed with the library.

    The \a init and \a destroy functions will be invoked as part of
    \a grpc_init() and \a grpc_shutdown(), respectively.
    Note that these functions can be invoked an arbitrary number of times
    (and hence so will \a init and \a destroy).
    It is safe to pass NULL to either argument. Plugins are destroyed in
    the reverse order they were initialized. */</doc>
