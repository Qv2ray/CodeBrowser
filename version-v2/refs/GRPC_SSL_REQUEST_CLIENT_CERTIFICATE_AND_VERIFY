     presents a certificate.

     If the client presents a certificate, the client authentication is done by
     the gRPC framework. (For a successful connection the client needs to either
     present a certificate that can be verified against the root certificate
     configured by the server or not present a certificate at all)

     The client&apos;s key certificate pair must be valid for the SSL connection to
     be established. */</doc>
