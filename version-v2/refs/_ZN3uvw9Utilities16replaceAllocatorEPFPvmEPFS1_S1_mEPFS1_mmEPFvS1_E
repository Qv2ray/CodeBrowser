     * @brief Override the use of some standard library’s functions.
     *
     * Override the use of the standard library’s memory allocation
     * functions.&lt;br/&gt;
     * This method must be invoked before any other `uvw` function is called or
     * after all resources have been freed and thus the underlying library
     * doesn’t reference any allocated memory chunk.
     *
     * If any of the function pointers is _null_, the invokation will fail.
     *
     * @note
     * There is no protection against changing the allocator multiple times. If
     * the user changes it they are responsible for making sure the allocator is
     * changed while no memory was allocated with the previous allocator, or
     * that they are compatible.
     *
     * @param mallocFunc Replacement function for _malloc_.
     * @param reallocFunc Replacement function for _realloc_.
     * @param callocFunc Replacement function for _calloc_.
     * @param freeFunc Replacement function for _free_.
     * @return True in case of success, false otherwise.
