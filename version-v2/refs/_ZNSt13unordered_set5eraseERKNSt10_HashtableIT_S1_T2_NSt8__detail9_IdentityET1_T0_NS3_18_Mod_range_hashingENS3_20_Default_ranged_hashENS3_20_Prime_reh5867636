       *  This function erases all the elements located by the given key from
       *  an %unordered_set. For an %unordered_set the result of this function
       *  can only be 0 (not present) or 1 (present).
       *  Note that this function only erases the element, and that if
       *  the element is itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is not touched
       *  in any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s responsibility.
