     * @brief Copies a file asynchronously from a path to a new one.
     *
     * Emit a `FsEvent&lt;FsReq::Type::UV_FS_COPYFILE&gt;` event when
     * completed.&lt;br/&gt;
     * Emit an ErrorEvent event in case of errors.
     *
     * Available flags are:
     *
     * * `FsReq::CopyFile::EXCL`: it fails if the destination path
     * already exists (the default behavior is to overwrite the destination if
     * it exists).
     * * `FsReq::CopyFile::FICLONE`: If present, it will attempt to create a
     * copy-on-write reflink. If the underlying platform does not support
     * copy-on-write, then a fallback copy mechanism is used.
     * * `FsReq::CopyFile::FICLONE_FORCE`: If present, it will attempt to create
     * a copy-on-write reflink. If the underlying platform does not support
     * copy-on-write, then an error is returned.
     *
     * @warning
     * If the destination path is created, but an error occurs while copying the
     * data, then the destination path is removed. There is a brief window of
     * time between closing and removing the file where another process could
     * access the file.
     *
     * @param old Old path, as described in the official documentation.
     * @param path New path, as described in the official documentation.
     * @param flags Optional additional flags.
