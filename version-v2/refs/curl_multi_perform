  * Name:    curl_multi_perform()
  *
  * Desc:    When the app thinks there&apos;s data available for curl it calls this
  *          function to read/write whatever there is right now. This returns
  *          as soon as the reads and writes are done. This function does not
  *          require that there actually is data available for reading or that
  *          data can be written, it can be called just in case. It returns
  *          the number of handles that still transfer data in the second
  *          argument&apos;s integer-pointer.
  *
  * Returns: CURLMcode type, general multi error code. *NOTE* that this only
  *          returns errors etc regarding the whole multi stack. There might
  *          still have occurred problems on individual transfers even when
  *          this returns OK.
