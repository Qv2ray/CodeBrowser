<doc f='include/google/protobuf/message.h' l='238'>// Clears all unknown fields from this message and all embedded messages.
  // Normally, if unknown tag numbers are encountered when parsing a message,
  // the tag and value are stored in the message&apos;s UnknownFieldSet and
  // then written back out when the message is serialized.  This allows servers
  // which simply route messages to other servers to pass through messages
  // that have new field definitions which they don&apos;t yet know about.  However,
  // this behavior can have security implications.  To avoid it, call this
  // method after parsing.
  //
  // See Reflection::GetUnknownFields() for more on unknown fields.</doc>
