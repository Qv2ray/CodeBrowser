<doc f='include/grpcpp/impl/codegen/sync_stream.h' l='126'>/// Write \a msg and coalesce it with the writing of trailing metadata, using
  /// WriteOptions \a options.
  ///
  /// For client, WriteLast is equivalent of performing Write and WritesDone in
  /// a single step. \a msg and trailing metadata are coalesced and sent on wire
  /// by calling this function. For server, WriteLast buffers the \a msg.
  /// The writing of \a msg is held until the service handler returns,
  /// where \a msg and trailing metadata are coalesced and sent on wire.
  /// Note that WriteLast can only buffer \a msg up to the flow control window
  /// size. If \a msg size is larger than the window size, it will be sent on
  /// wire without buffering.
  ///
  /// \param[in] msg The message to be written to the stream.
  /// \param[in] options The WriteOptions to be used to write this message.</doc>
