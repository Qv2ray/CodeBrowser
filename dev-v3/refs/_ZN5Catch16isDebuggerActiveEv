<doc f='qv2ray/test/catch.hpp' l='10413'>// The standard POSIX way of detecting a debugger is to attempt to
        // ptrace() the process, but this needs to be done from a child and not
        // this process itself to still allow attaching to this process later
        // if wanted, so is rather heavy. Under Linux we have the PID of the
        // &quot;debugger&quot; (which doesn&apos;t need to be gdb, of course, it could also
        // be strace, for example) in /proc/$PID/status, so just get it from
        // there instead.</doc>
