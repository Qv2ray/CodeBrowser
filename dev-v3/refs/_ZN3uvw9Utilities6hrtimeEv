     * @brief Gets the current high-resolution real time.
     *
     * The time is expressed in nanoseconds. It is relative to an arbitrary time
     * in the past. It is not related to the time of the day and therefore not
     * subject to clock drift. The primary use is for measuring performance
     * between interval.
