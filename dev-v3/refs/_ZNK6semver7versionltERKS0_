     * @brief Compares two instances.
     *
     * An instance is less than another if its version number is less than the
     * other&apos;s.  Components are compared one by one, starting from the first.
     * If the two components are equal, then the following component is
     * considered.  If the first component is less than the second, then `true`
     * is returned, otherwise `false` is returned.
     *
     * @param v The instance to be compared with.
     * @return `true` if this instance is less than @p rh, `false` otherwise.
