     * @brief Copies a file synchronously from a path to a new one.
     *
     * Available flags are:
     *
     * * `FsReq::CopyFile::EXCL`: it fails if the destination path
     * already exists (the default behavior is to overwrite the destination if
     * it exists).
     *
     * If the destination path is created, but an error occurs while copying the
     * data, then the destination path is removed. There is a brief window of
     * time between closing and removing the file where another process could
     * access the file.
     *
     * @param old Old path, as described in the official documentation.
     * @param path New path, as described in the official documentation.
     * @param flags Optional additional flags.
     * @return True in case of success, false otherwise.
