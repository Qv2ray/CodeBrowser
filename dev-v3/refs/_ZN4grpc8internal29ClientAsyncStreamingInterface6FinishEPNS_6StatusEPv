  ///     \a ClientAsyncReaderWriterInterface::WritesDone).
  ///   * there are no more messages to be received from the server (this can
  ///     be known implicitly by the calling code, or explicitly from an
  ///     earlier call to \a AsyncReaderInterface::Read that yielded a failed
  ///     result, e.g. cq-&gt;Next(&amp;read_tag, &amp;ok) filled in &apos;ok&apos; with &apos;false&apos;).
