<doc f='include/grpc/grpc.h' l='295'>/** Create a client channel to &apos;target&apos;. Additional channel level configuration
    MAY be provided by grpc_channel_args, though the expectation is that most
    clients will want to simply pass NULL. The user data in &apos;args&apos; need only
    live through the invocation of this function. However, if any args of the
    &apos;pointer&apos; type are passed, then the referenced vtable must be maintained
    by the caller until grpc_channel_destroy terminates. See grpc_channel_args
    definition for more on this. */</doc>
