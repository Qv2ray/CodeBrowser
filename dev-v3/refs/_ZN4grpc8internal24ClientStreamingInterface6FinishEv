  /// It is appropriate to call this method when both:
  ///   * the calling code (client-side) has no more message to send
  ///     (this can be declared implicitly by calling this method, or
  ///     explicitly through an earlier call to &lt;i&gt;WritesDone&lt;/i&gt; method of the
  ///     class in use, e.g. \a ClientWriterInterface::WritesDone or
  ///     \a ClientReaderWriterInterface::WritesDone).
  ///   * there are no more messages to be received from the server (which can
  ///     be known implicitly, or explicitly from an earlier call to \a
  ///     ReaderInterface::Read that returned &quot;false&quot;).
  ///
  /// This function will return either:
  /// - when all incoming messages have been read and the server has
  ///   returned status.
  /// - when the server has returned a non-OK status.
  /// - OR when the call failed for some reason and the library generated a
  ///   status.
  ///
  /// Return values:
  ///   - \a Status contains the status code, message and details for the call
  ///   - the \a ClientContext associated with this call is updated with
  ///     possible trailing metadata sent from the server.</doc>
