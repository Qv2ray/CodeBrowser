       *  @brief Erases an element from a %multimap.

       *  @return An iterator pointing to the element immediately following
       *          @a position prior to the element being erased. If no such
       *          element exists, end() is returned.

       *  This function erases an element, pointed to by the given iterator,
       *  from a %multimap.  Note that this function only erases the element,
       *  and that if the element is itself a pointer, the pointed-to memory is
       *  not touched in any way.  Managing the pointer is the user&apos;s
       *  responsibility.
