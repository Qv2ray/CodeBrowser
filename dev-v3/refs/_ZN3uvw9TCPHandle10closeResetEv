     * @brief Resets a TCP connection by sending a RST packet.
     *
     * This is accomplished by setting the `SO_LINGER` socket option with a
     * linger interval of zero and then calling `close`.&lt;br/&gt;
     * Due to some platform inconsistencies, mixing of `shutdown` and
     * `closeReset` calls is not allowed.
     *
     * A CloseEvent event is emitted when the connection has been reset.&lt;br/&gt;
     * An ErrorEvent event is emitted in case of errors.
