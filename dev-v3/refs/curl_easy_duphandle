 * NAME curl_easy_duphandle()
 *
 * DESCRIPTION
 *
 * Creates a new curl session handle with the same options set for the handle
 * passed in. Duplicating a handle could only be a matter of cloning data and
 * options, internal state info and things like persistent connections cannot
 * be transferred. It is useful in multithreaded applications when you can run
 * curl_easy_duphandle() for each new thread to avoid a series of identical
 * curl_easy_setopt() invokes in every thread.
