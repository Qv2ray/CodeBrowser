  // by Next() is not actually written.  This is needed when you finish
  // writing all the data you want to write, but the last buffer was bigger
  // than you needed.  You don&apos;t want to write a bunch of garbage after the
  // end of your data, so you use BackUp() to back up.

  // Preconditions:
  // * The last method called must have been Next().
  // * count must be less than or equal to the size of the last buffer
  //   returned by Next().
  // * The caller must not have written anything to the last &quot;count&quot; bytes
  //   of that buffer.
  //
  // Postconditions:
  // * The last &quot;count&quot; bytes of the last buffer returned by Next() will be
  //   ignored.</doc>
