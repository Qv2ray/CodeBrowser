     * @brief Disables inheritance for file descriptors/handles.
     *
     * Disables inheritance for file descriptors/handles that this process
     * inherited from its parent. The effect is that child processes spawned by
     * this process donâ€™t accidentally inherit these handles.&lt;br/&gt;
     * It is recommended to call this function as early in your program as
     * possible, before the inherited file descriptors can be closed or
     * duplicated.
     *
     * See the official
     * [documentation](http://docs.libuv.org/en/v1.x/process.html#c.uv_disable_stdio_inheritance)
     * for further details.
