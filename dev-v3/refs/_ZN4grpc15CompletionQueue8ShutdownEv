  /// \warning This method must be called at some point if this completion queue
  /// is accessed with Next or AsyncNext. \a Next will not return false
  /// until this method has been called and all pending tags have been drained.
  /// (Likewise for \a AsyncNext returning \a NextStatus::SHUTDOWN .)
  /// Only once either one of these methods does that (that is, once the queue
  /// has been \em drained) can an instance of this class be destroyed.
  /// Also note that applications must ensure that no work is enqueued on this
  /// completion queue after this method is called.</doc>
