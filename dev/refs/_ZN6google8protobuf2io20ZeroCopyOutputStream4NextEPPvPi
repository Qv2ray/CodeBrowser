  // into this buffer will eventually (maybe instantly, maybe later on)
  // be written to the output.
  //
  // Preconditions:
  // * &quot;size&quot; and &quot;data&quot; are not NULL.
  //
  // Postconditions:
  // * If the returned value is false, an error occurred.  All errors are
  //   permanent.
  // * Otherwise, &quot;size&quot; points to the actual number of bytes in the buffer
  //   and &quot;data&quot; points to the buffer.
  // * Ownership of this buffer remains with the stream, and the buffer
  //   remains valid only until some other method of the stream is called
  //   or the stream is destroyed.
  // * Any data which the caller stores in this buffer will eventually be
  //   written to the output (unless BackUp() is called).
  // * It is legal for the returned buffer to have zero size, as long
  //   as repeatedly calling Next() eventually yields a buffer with non-zero
  //   size.</doc>
