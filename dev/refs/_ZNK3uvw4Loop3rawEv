     * @brief Gets the underlying raw data structure.
     *
     * This function should not be used, unless you know exactly what you are
     * doing and what are the risks.&lt;br/&gt;
     * Going raw is dangerous, mainly because the lifetime management of a loop,
     * a handle or a request is in charge to the library itself and users should
     * not work around it.
     *
     * @warning
     * Use this function at your own risk, but do not expect any support in case
     * of bugs.
     *
     * @return The underlying raw data structure.
