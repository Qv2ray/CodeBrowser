     * @brief Retrieves the scheduling priority of a process.

     * The returned value is between -20 (high priority) and 19 (low priority).
     * A value that is out of range is returned in case of errors.
     *
     * @note
     * On Windows, the result won&apos;t equal necessarily the exact value of the
     * priority because of a mapping to a Windows priority class.
     *
     * @param pid A valid process id.
     * @return The scheduling priority of the process.
