     transient condition and may be corrected by retrying with
     a backoff.

     WARNING: Although data MIGHT not have been transmitted when this
     status occurs, there is NOT A GUARANTEE that the server has not seen
     anything. So in general it is unsafe to retry on this status code
     if the call is non-idempotent.

     See litmus test above for deciding between FAILED_PRECONDITION,
     ABORTED, and UNAVAILABLE. */</doc>
